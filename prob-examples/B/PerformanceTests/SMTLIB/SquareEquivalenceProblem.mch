Problem by Sanjit Seshia, UC Berkeley


Are the following functions equivalent:
int fun1(int y) {
    int x, z;
    z = y;
    y = x;
    x = z;
   return x*x;
}

int fun2(int y) {
      return y*y;
}


Translation into logic:
( z = y & y1 = x  & x1 = z  & ret1 = x1*x1)

      &

( ret2 = y*y )

      &

( ret1 â‰  ret2 )

Using SAT to check equivalence (w/ Minisat)

    32 bits for y: Did not finish in over 5 hours

    16 bits for y: 37 sec.

      8 bits for y: 0.5 sec. 

Using EUF solver: 0.01 sec.
