# A Collection of Formal Specifications

## Rationale

Many formal methods research communities
do not share a common benchmark set.
Working towards a shared repository of specifications
will improve several shortcomings currently present in academia:

- Benchmarks used in research papers often are not made permanent
  or are stored on webservers that move or delete shortly (after a few years) thereafter.
- Approaches using machine learning require a large data set.
  More available specifications simply means more data for them.
- Examples used in education can be shared.
- By adding meta-information, one can identify suitable benchmarks
  for a new technique more easily.

## Meta-Information

Meta-information is stored separately from the specification.
The exact format is work-in-progress.
The idea is that a small amount of data should be mandatory,
and that it must be extensible with optional data
that may be specific to a technique regarding model checking, predicate solving, etc.

## Contributions

Contributions are explicitly welcome.
The initial data in this repository is our collection of examples used for ProB.
This repository is not limited to specifications written in the B family:
we already include specifications written in CSP, Z, TLA+, and so on.
We accept pull requests containing additional specifications,
as long as proper meta-information is included.

## Updates

Once submitted, specifications shall not be deleted or modified.
Updated versions can be submitted and stored in new files / directories.
Comments in the meta-information can explain differences and relationships
between several versions.
